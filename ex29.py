# STUDY DRILLS
# In this Study Drill, try to guess what you think the if-statement is and what it does. Try to answer these questions in your own words before moving on to the next exercise:

# 1. What do you think the if does to the code under it?

# 2. Why does the code under the if need to be indented four spaces?

# 3. What happens if it isnâ€™t indented?

# 4. Can you put other Boolean expressions from Exercise 27 in the if-statement? Try it.

# 5. What happens if you change the initial values for people, cats, and dogs?
