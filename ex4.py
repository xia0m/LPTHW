# This exercise is for variable and names

# To define a new variable

cars = 100
space_in_a_car = 4.0

total_cars = cars * space_in_a_car

print("the total car is",total_cars,"avaliable")

# Study Drill
# 1. I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it’s just 4?
print(100 * 4)
print(100 * 4.0)
print(100.0*4)

# 2. Remember that 4.0 is a floating point number. It’s just a number with a decimal point, and you need 4.0 instead of just 4 so that it is floating point.

# 3. Write comments above each of the variable assignments.

# 4. Make sure you know what = is called (equals) and that its purpose is to give data (numbers, strings, etc.) names (cars_driven, passengers).

# 5. Remember that _ is an underscore character.

# 6. Try running python3.6 from the Terminal as a calculator like you did before, and use variable names to do your calculations. Popular variable names include i, x, and j.
