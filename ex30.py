# STUDY DRILLS
# 1. Try to guess what elif and else are doing.

# 2. Change the numbers of cars, people, and trucks, and then trace through each if-statement to see what will be printed.

# 3. Try some more complex Boolean expressions like cars > people or trucks < cars.

# 4. Above each line write a comment describing what the line does.
