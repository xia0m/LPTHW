# STUDY DRILLS
# 1. Draw a map of the game and how you flow through it.

# 2. Fix all of your mistakes, including spelling mistakes.

# 3. Write comments for the functions you do not understand.

# 4. Add more to the game. What can you do to both simplify and expand it?

# 5. The gold_room has a weird way of getting you to type a number. What are all the bugs in this way of doing it? Can you make it better than what Iâ€™ve written? Look at how int() works for clues.
